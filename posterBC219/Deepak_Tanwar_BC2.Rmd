# Introduction

Short RNAs, categorized as non-coding RNA molecules, are less than 200 nucleotides in length and play a vital role in the regulation of the genome. They have been implicated in a large number of biological processes and pathological conditions. With the advancement in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques, it is now possible to sequence and study short RNAs [@Stark2019; @Mehta2014]. However, short RNA studies are hampered by several technical issues, including the bioinformatic analysis of short RNA sequencing data:

1. Analysis methods are not simultaneously optimized towards all known short RNA types (e.g. miRNA, piRNA, rasiRNA, siRNA, snoRNA, tsRNA, tRFs, srRNA and U-RNA). On top of multiplying the work needed for an extensive analysis of the data, this can potentially create misassignment mistakes.

2. Current methods either do not deal adequately with post-transcriptional modifications (for genome-based methods); or if they do (transcript-based methods), they do not deal with unannotated features.

3. Current methods do not adequately account for the hierarchical organization of the features one might want to quantify or test.

4. There is still no consensus on the most appropriate normalization method for short-RNA-Seq data.

### Example 1

**The issue of post-transcriptional modifications:**

**tRNA-iMet-CAT-4** is transcribed from chrX, and as other tRNAs receives post-transcriptionally the 3' addition of the nucleotides CCA:

... TCCTCTGCTT &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&rarr; <font color="red">aligns to multiple locations on the genome</font><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&darr;<br>
... TCCTCTGCTT**CCA** &nbsp;&rarr; <font color="red">does not align to the genome</font>


To deal with this, researchers have often simply trimmed 3' CCAs before alignment, however, this can often result in the read becoming ambiguous when instead it initially wasn't, as in the case above. One solution to this issue is to build a custom genome that is complemented with known, post-transcriptionally modified transcripts [@Hoffmann2017].

### Example 2

**The issue of ambiguity between related features:**
tRNA typically have several copies across the genome - for instance, tRNA-Ala-AGC has 23 nearly-identical copies. While a genome alignment will make most reads from such features ambiguous (i.e. multi-mapping), from a functional point of view it is irrelevant from which exact location they came from. This issue becomes even more critical with tRNA fragments, which often have conserved sequences across different tRNAs. One way to address this issue is to aggregate reads into functional equivalence classes, i.e. higher level than specific genes/transcripts.


# Objectives

Because of these shortcomings, we developed a new analysis framework that addresses these issues using alternative nested equivalence classes over a customized annotation. We present this approach and package, and show how it can be used to redress biases in the quantification of both specific RNA as well as large RNA classes.


# Methods

shortRNA R package is an extension to the **TreeSummarised-Experiment** object.

## Comparison of shortRNA with other methods

We compared 20 published tools for 23 features.

```{r, comparison, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=11.5, results='asis'}
file <- readxl::read_excel("./files/Tools_comparison.xlsx", sheet = 2)

file <- apply(file, 2, function(x)gsub(pattern = "\n", replacement = ", ", x = as.character(x)))

library(plyr)
library(kableExtra)

file <- t(file)
colnames(file) <- file[1,]
file <- file[-1,]
file <- data.frame(Features = rownames(file), file, check.names = F)
rownames(file) <- NULL


file %>%
kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 26)
```


# Conclusions

- **Standalone** R package for short RNA-Seq data analysis.

- Extension to the **TreeSummarizedExperiment** object.

- QC, alignment, differential analysis, and functional analysis within the package.

- **Hierarchical**: could easily be extended to additional feature trees (for example Vault RNAs).

- shortRNA can be successfully implemented to **investigate the role of short RNAs** in various studies.
